**FORKED FROM TUNA**
On my laptop, in the `${HOME}/.ssh/config` file, I added:

```
Host singularity_*
  RemoteCommand singularity run -B /scratch/$USER/work -B /ospool/uc-shared/public/futurecolliders/BIB10TeV:/data/bib10 -B /ospool/uc-shared/user/$USER/data/samples/:/data/HBB /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/infnpd/mucoll-ilc-framework:1.6-centos8
  RequestTTY yes
Host ap23 singularity_ap23
  HostName ap23.uc.osg-htc.org
  User <username>
```

The key is `RemoteCommand`, which can execute a command upon login. The other lines are hopefully self-explanatory.

You can check if this works by running `ssh k4toroid_snowmass` from the command line. If successful, it should log into snowmass and immediately start `apptainer`. If that doesn't work, you can also try running `ssh snowmass` to see if a connection without `RemoteCommand` works.

# ap23

On `ap23.uc.osg-htc.org`, in the `${HOME}/.bashrc` file, I added:

```
if [ "$SINGULARITY_NAME" == 'mucoll-ilc-framework:1.6-centos8' ]; then
    source /opt/ilcsoft/muonc/init_ilcsoft.sh
fi
```

This sets up the Singularity software whenever the apptainer environment starts, including for VSCode.

# VSCode

- Install the `Remote - SSH` extension
- In Settings, enable "Remote.SSH: Enable Remote Command" (`remote.SSH.enableRemoteCommand`)
- `Connect to...` -> `Connect to Host` -> `singularity_ap23`
